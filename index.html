                No, it's not the animal mouse, but the PC mouse. Most likely the thing
                you are holding if you are on the laptop or PC. The mouse is practically one of
                the most famous things in the world, and likely one of the things someone would
                list down when naming computer components.

                <p>Now, where did the mouse come from? Many people do not really bother checking the
                    history of the mouse. Most people assume it is an invention, which, yes, it is.
                </p>
                <p>Now, the first mouse was originally a military secret; back in 1946, the first
                    mouse was created as a part of a British Navy Project about tracking
                    aircrafts on the radar. The mouse's design was rough and basic:
                    a ball placed on top of spinning metal discs with wires.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h3><b>Since it was a military secret, it only became known 2 decades later.</b></h3>
                </p>
                <p>The first actual mouse was created by Douglas Engelbart and his team at
                    the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in 1964. There were a few
                    prototypes before 1964, but the 1964 was the first mouse officially.
                    It looked like a wooden box with some wheels underneath the box
                    that moved in perpendicular directions, which would move
                    the cursor on screen.
                </p>
                <p>The German company Telefunken released the first trackball based mouse named the Rollkugel
                    or “rolling ball” in English. The mouse was a scaled down version of what the British Navy had
                    been working on, its design had a single button and was used for drawing vector graphics.
                </p>
                <p>In 1972, Bill English, a computer engineer working for Xerox Palo Alto Research Centre, created the
                    “ball mouse”. It was part of the Xerox Alto computer, the first personal system with a graphical
                    user interface.

                    In this attempt, there were no wheels but a ball to move the mouse in any direction. The ball was in
                    contact with axles attached to some rollers. With every movement, the axles produced electrical
                    pulses sent to sensors that registered the direction the mouse was moving in. It was supposedly
                    an iteration of the rolling ball mouse.
                </p>
                <p>1983 was an important year for the mouse. Microsoft updated MS-DOS program Microsoft Word,
                    creating the first PC-compatible mouse, then, Apple, Atari, and Commodore jump on the wave
                    as well. And just one year later, Apple released the first Macintosh and that was a definitive
                    step to popularize the device.

                    The developments during the 90’s gave us ergonomic changes and the optical mouse. Finally, in 1999,
                    it
                    entered the market. A more resistant mouse that swiftly moved on surfaces like pads, tabletops,
                    thanks
                    to its optical sensors.

                    In 2004, Logitech got the spotlight with its laser mouse. Its laser beam offered much more accurate
                    tracking because it could identify surfaces under the mouse more precisely than LEDs.

                <p>The word 'mouse' was named as such as it looked similarly
                    to a mouse with a tail, leading to the name 'mouse'. The
                    wire 'tail' originally came out under the user's wrist when
                    using the mouse.

                <p>The scroll wheel, the wheel between the buttons, which allows the user

                    the scroll wheel. Touching it would turn the mouse cursor to a wheel
                    that moves depending on which half of the page the cursor is in. (4)
